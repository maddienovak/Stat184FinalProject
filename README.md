# Stat184FinalProject
Final Project in RStudio for Statistics 184. I will be looking at two different datasets from two different sources. One dataset is about fires
in Portugal and the other is about Climate Change in many countries. I am investigating if the increase in climate change over the years has impacted
the wild forest fires in Portugal but since I have limits on my data I will only be looking at the years of 2000 - 2007 on both datasets. The portugal wildfire dataset
does not include the years but the data sources indicates that the data was taken from 2000 to 2007.
