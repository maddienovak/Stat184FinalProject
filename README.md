# Stat 184 Final Project

Final Project in RStudio for Statistics 184.

What my main goal for this project is to discover and investigate some correlation between the variables given in the forest_fires dataset and number of fires. Over the recent years, news has broken out over how our enviroment is suffering and I want to know if these forest fires are a cause of global warming from over the past two decades. I want to see if any of the variables given in the forest_fires dataset correlate with the number of fires in Portugal. In addition to this, I am going to be exploring the number of fires in each month for both Brazil and Portugal. Since my dataset for Brazil was not as detailed as Portugal dataset, I will NOT be investigating the factors that cause Brazil fires but only Portugal.
